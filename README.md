## Hi there 👋

🔭 I'm currently studying at a technical school, where I learn front-end, back-end and data base.

🌱 Besides, I'm learning from courses, like udemy and going to lectures when not doing school work.

👯 I'm mainly looking to intern with front-end, but if there's a vacancy in another area I'm willing to do my best 😊.

📫 How to contact me:

- ⚡ Fun fact: Without being in the IT area, I would follow the police area, like the army or something like that.
