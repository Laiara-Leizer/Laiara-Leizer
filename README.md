# Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ I'm currently studying at a technical school and my course is IT. I learn front-end, back-end and database.

ğŸ’» Some of the languages â€‹â€‹and items I study:

   * Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

   * Frameworks/libraries: Angular.js, React, Bootstrap.

   * Back-end: Node.js, JavaScript, Java.
   
   * Database: MongoDB, MySQL

ğŸŒ± Besides, I'm learning from courses, like udemy and going to lectures when not doing school work.

ğŸ‘¯ I'm mainly looking to intern with front-end, but if there's a vacancy in another area I'm willing to do my best ğŸ˜Š.

ğŸ“« How to contact me:
   Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/laiara-leizer-30b18a318/ or
   Email: laiaraleizer06@gmail.com
   
âš¡ Fun fact: Without being in the IT area, I would follow the police area, like the army or something like that.
